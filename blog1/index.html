      <h2>Does being furloughed affect mortgage applications?</h2>

      <p>Around 9.6 million people in the UK have been furloughed since the start of the covid-19 pandemic (Express, 2021). </p>
      <p>This means these people were all placed on leave and received up to 80% of their salary with a ceiling of £2,500 a month (Express, 2021). The UK furlough scheme was designed to allow people to go into lockdown without working but continue to receive their salary to pay for essentials.</p>
        <p>But can you get a mortgage when on furlough? The answer is yes. Some people will be able to get a mortgage whilst on furlough. This is because the biggest factor for banks when deciding to give a person a mortgage or not, is the stability of the applicant’s income. Of course, some banks would class income through furlough as an unstable income, but others will say otherwise. If you work for a business which is under threat meaning your income is also under threat then banks are less likely to accept the mortgage application. Mortgage providers for this reason are currently trying to avoid lending money to workers in “high risk” industries (Express, 2021). </p>
        <p> However, if the business or sector you work in is more stable then you will be likely accepted for a mortgage. In this case the lenders will take into account the applicant’s full yearly salary, excluding overtime and commission, and not just the 80% they receive currently through the furlough scheme (Express, 2021). Some mortgage lenders will also request an employer to prove that an applicant is telling the truth about their full annual income, because some applicants may go back to work on less pay than what they were on before they were furloughed.</p>
        <p>If you are looking to re-mortgage then the process should be a lot easier and straight forward. Applicants wanting to re-mortgage should be able to stay with the same mortgage lender and simply switch mortgages, even if they are furloughed (Express, 2021). But this is only if the application is not asking for more money. </p>
